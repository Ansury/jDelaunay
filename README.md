BSD 3-Clause license

This is a "fork" (actually more like an archive/mirror) of Mark Howison's jmescher library used for constrained Delaunay triangulation (currently located at https://code.google.com/archive/p/jmescher/), uploaded to address a possible license issue with the javax.vecmath dependency (which is GPL licensed) by removing all javax.vecmath classes.

Other dependencies: Apfloat for Java (LGPL)
